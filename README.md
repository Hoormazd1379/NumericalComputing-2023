# Numerical Computing Course Repository

This repository contains lecture notes, assignments, and projects for the Numerical Computing course. The course focuses on the development and analysis of algorithms for solving important problems in science, engineering, medicine, and business through numerical computation. Below, you will find important information about the course and how this repository is organized.

## Course Description

Numerical computing is an interdisciplinary field that combines computer science and mathematics to solve real-world problems. In this course, students will learn the principles and practices of basic numerical computation. The course includes five hands-on numerical programming mini-projects and a bonus assignment. Topics covered include the PageRank algorithm, linear algebra applications, one-dimensional nonlinear equations, linear equations, linear least squares, and data fitting.

### Lecture Slides, Projects, and Solutions

- Lecture slides, project descriptions, and solutions will be provided on this repository.
- For each mini-project, you are required to submit your code and summarize your results in a report.
- The quality of your report is an important part of your evaluation.
- Mini-projects are graded out of 85 points, with an additional 15 points awarded for report quality (maximum grade: 10, total 100 points).

## Lab & Coursework

- Lab requirements include programming mini-projects, a bonus assignment, and a final written or oral examination.
- Mini-projects contribute 40% to your final grade.
- Bonus assignment contributes 10%.
- The final exam contributes 60%.
- To be admitted to the final exam, you must achieve an average grade of at least 5/10 in the 5 mini-projects.
- The maximum grade is 10/10.

### Final Exam

- The final exam covers material from the entire course, including mini-projects and theory.
- We may discuss your solutions during the exam.

### Textbooks

- **Theory**: The primary textbook for the course is "A First Course in Numerical Methods" by C. Greif and U. Ascher.
- **Programming**: MATLAB will be the main programming language for mini-projects.

### Regrading Requests

- If you believe your mini-project deserves a better grade, you can submit a regrade request within one week after the assignment grading.
- The TA will reevaluate your assignment and issue a decision.
- If you are still not satisfied, you can appeal to Dr. Vecchi within one week after the TA reply.

### Submission / Late Day Policy

- Mini-project solution reports must use the provided LaTeX template and be uploaded on iCorsi before the deadline.
- Late submissions will not be graded and will receive 0 points.
- Bonus assignments follow the same submission rules.

### Assignment Collaboration Policy

- You are allowed to discuss mini-project questions with others, but you must list everyone you discussed solutions with.
- Submissions must be written independently; joint submissions are not allowed.
- Plagiarism will result in harsh penalties, including a 0 score for all involved students.
